/**
  *
  * @param title   A short, human-readable, title for this code action.
  * @param kind The kind of the code action.
  *                 Used to filter code actions.
  * @param diagnostics The diagnostics that this code action resolves.
  * @param isPreferred Marks this as a preferred action. Preferred actions are used by the `auto fix` command and can be targeted
  *                 by keybindings.
  *                 A quick fix should be marked preferred if it properly addresses the underlying error.
  *                 A refactoring should be marked preferred if it is the most reasonable choice of actions to take.
  * @param edit     The workspace edit this code action performs.
  * @param command A command this code action executes. If a code action
  *                 provides an edit and a command, first the edit is
  *                 executed and then the command.
