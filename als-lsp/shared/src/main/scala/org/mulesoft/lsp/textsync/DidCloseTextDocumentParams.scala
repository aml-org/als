/** The document close notification is sent from the client to the server when
  *  the document got closed in the client. The document’s truth now exists where
  *  the document’s Uri points to (e.g. if the document’s Uri is a file Uri the
  *  truth now exists on disk). As with the open notification the close notification
  *  is about managing the document’s content. Receiving a close notification
  *  doesn't mean that the document was open in an editor before. A close notification
  *  requires a previous open notification to be sent. Note that a server’s ability
  *  to fulfill requests is independent of whether a text document is open or closed.
  *
  * @param textDocument The document that was closed.
