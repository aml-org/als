/** The initialize request is sent as the first request from the client to the server. If the server receives a request or notification before the initialize request it should act as follows:
  *
  * For a request the response should be an error with code: -32002. The message can be picked by the server.
  * Notifications should be dropped, except for the exit notification. This will allow the exit of a server without an initialize request.
  * Until the server has responded to the initialize request with an InitializeResult, the client must not send any additional requests or notifications to the server. In addition the server is not allowed to send any requests or notifications to the client until it has responded with an InitializeResult, with the exception that during the initialize request the server is allowed to send the notifications window/showMessage, window/logMessage and telemetry/event as well as the window/showMessageRequest request to the client.
  *
  * The initialize request may only be sent once.
  *
  * Request:
  *
  * method: ‘initialize’
  * params: InitializeParams defined as follows:
  *
  * @param capabilities          The capabilities provided by the client (editor or tool)
  * @param trace                 The initial trace setting. If omitted trace is disabled ('off').
  * @param rootUri               The rootUri of the workspace. Is None if no
  *                              folder is open. If both `rootPath` and `rootUri` are set
  *                              `rootUri` wins.
  * @param processId             The process Id of the parent process that started
  *                              the server. Is None if the process has not been started by another process.
  *                              If the parent process is not alive then the server should exit (see exit notification) its process.
  * @param workspaceFolders      The workspace folders configured in the client when the server starts.
  *                              This property is only available if the client supports workspace folders.
  *                              It can be `None` if the client supports workspace folders but none are
  *                              configured.
  * @param rootPath              The rootPath of the workspace. Is null
  *                              if no folder is open.
  * @param initializationOptions User provided initialization options.
