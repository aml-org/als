/**
  * ClientCapabilities now define capabilities for dynamic registration, workspace and text document features the client supports. The experimental can be used to pass experimental capabilities under development. For future compatibility a ClientCapabilities object literal can have more properties set than currently defined. Servers receiving a ClientCapabilities object literal with unknown properties should ignore these properties. A missing property should be interpreted as an absence of the capability. If a missing property normally defines sub properties, all missing sub properties should be interpreted as an absence of the corresponding capability.
  *
  * @param workspace    Workspace specific client capabilities.
  * @param textDocument Text document specific client capabilities.
  * @param experimental Experimental client capabilities.
