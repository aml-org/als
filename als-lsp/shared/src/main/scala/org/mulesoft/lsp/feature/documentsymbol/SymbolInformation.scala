/**
  * Represents information about programming constructs like variables, classes,
  * interfaces etc.
  *
  * @param name          The name of this symbol.
  * @param kind          The kind of this symbol.
  * @param location      The location of this symbol. The location's range is used by a tool
  *                      to reveal the location in the editor. If the symbol is selected in the
  *                      tool the range's start information is used to position the cursor. So
  *                      the range usually spans more then the actual symbol's name and does
  *                      normally include things like visibility modifiers.
  *
  *                      The range doesn't have to denote a node range in the sense of a abstract
  *                      syntax tree. It can therefore not be used to re-construct a hierarchy of
  *                      the symbols.
  * @param containerName The name of the symbol containing this symbol. This information is for
  *                      user interface purposes (e.g. to render a qualifier in the user interface
  *                      if necessary). It can't be used to re-infer a hierarchy for the document
  *                      symbols.
  * @param deprecated    Indicates if this symbol is deprecated.
