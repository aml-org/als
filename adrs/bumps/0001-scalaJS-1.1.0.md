# 1. Bump ScalaJS from 0.6 to 1.1

Date: 2023-03-10

## Status
In Progress

## Context
Bump ScalaJS from 0.6 to 1.1 had a lot of compatibility issues with some plugins and dependencies, like:

- sbt-scalajs: 1.6.0 
- scalatest
- upickle
- node v16.19.0


## Decision
1. We follow AMF suggestion to use `sbt-scalaJS:1.6.0` instead of `1.7.0+` beacuse of _RegEx adaption_
2. We found a `scalatest` version that has compatibility with `scalaJS 1`
3. `upickle` use `scalaJS 1` since `0.9.x`. [See more details](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.lihaoyi/upickle_sjs1_2.12)
4. For node 16 we decide to use `scala-js-nodejs-v14` from `net-exoego`. We had to downgrade to _Node 14_ because this is used only for **Test mode** and for _Node 16_ there was just one version and this unique version requires `sbt-scalajs 1.8.0+`

## Issues
- Changing to latest `Upickle` version fix compatibility with `sbt-scalaJS` but fail all `als-suggestion` tests because the write function of an empty array change from:
`[]` to 
`[ \n ]`
- Some code had to been changed because of deprecated packages
- Some `@JSExport` annotations were changed to `@JSExportTopLevel`
- Workspaces name were removed from exported annotations
- `ScalaJSModuleKind` was replaced with `scalaJSLinkerConfig ~= { _.withModuleKind(ModuleKind.CommonJSModule)
.withESFeatures(_.withESVersion(ESVersion.ES2016))
  }`
- Other replacements (depends of scala version):
  - `fastOptJS` -> `fastLinkJS`
  - `fullOptJS` -> `fullLinkJS`
  - `artifactPath` -> `scalaJSLinkerOutputDirectory`
  
  ** NOTE: This modifications in the linkerJS config change the way that the autogenerated JS file is created. It creates a folder with main.js files instead of .js files. Keep in mind that for some commands (i.e. buildServerJsLibrary) need to run an script that move those file to another dir. If this config is updated the script file need to be fixed.
- Some commons dependencies do not on JS, so we need to add those using `libraryDependencies` in _JS Settings_ section.
