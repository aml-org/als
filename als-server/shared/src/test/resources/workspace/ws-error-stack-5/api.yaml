    The transactional messaging API sends transactional (aka operational) messages initiated by a recipient or systsem confirming the casdfasdfompletion of a process (for non-promotional reasons), with expectations of immediate delivery. For example, sending a confirmation message after a customer makes a purchase.
    A transactional send is invoked outside of the application using API calls. Configure the content and contact behavior via the `definitions` API resource.
    Use a API `messages` resource to provide automated, personalized responses to your customers' activities on your website. Emails and SMS are trackable, targeted, and sent in real time.
