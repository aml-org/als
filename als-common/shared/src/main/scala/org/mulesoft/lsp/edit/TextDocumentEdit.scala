/**
  * Describes textual changes on a single text document. The text document is referred to as a
  * VersionedTextDocumentIdentifier to allow clients to check the text document version before an edit is applied. A
  * TextDocumentEdit describes all changes on a version Si and after they are applied move the document to version
  * Si+1. So the creator of a TextDocumentEdit doesnâ€™t need to sort the array or do any kind of ordering. However
  * the edits must be non overlapping.
  *
  * @param textDocument The text document to change.
  * @param edits The edits to be applied.
